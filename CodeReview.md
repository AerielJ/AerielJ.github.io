## Informal Code Review
Prior to modifying the artifacts in my final project ePortolio, I conducted a code review to discuss my plans for modification and enhancement. In my code review video, I discuss the artifacts that I have chosen to include in my ePortfolio final project, do a walkthrough and code review of each artifactâ€™s existing code, and go over my plans for enhancements.
