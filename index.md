## Aeriel J's ePortfolio


### Introduction
I have been in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University since October 2018. While in the program, I learned many techniques, practices, languages, and concepts relevant to computer science career fields. The three concepts or skills that I find most important are programming languages, secure coding, and the software development life cycle. During my studies, I worked with several programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, SQL, and Assembly Language. I learned how to identify common security vulnerabilities and write secure code to mitigate risks to software and data. I explored the stages of the Software Development Lifecycle and practiced working in an agile development environment. 

I am looking for a future career in software development. Software development falls under the general umbrella of computer science. My career goal is to become a software developer. To support this goal, I plan to earn a masterâ€™s degree in software development. While I study for my degree, I aim to gain experience through an internship or entry-level developer job and obtain certifications to help boost my credentials. I am targeting to specialize in application development, but I am also interested in security development.
