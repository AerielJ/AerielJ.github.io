## Aeriel J's ePortfolio


### Introduction
I have been in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University since October 2018. I am now in the process of completing my final course, CS 499 Computer Science Capstone, and obtaining a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. My career goal is to become a software developer. In addition to earning my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, I plan to support this goal by gaining experience through an internship or entry-level developer job and obtaining certifications to boost my credentials. I am targeting to specialize in application development, but I am also interested in security development. I have created this ePortfolio to showcase the skills and knowledge I have obtained throughout the Computer Science program and demonstrate my strengths in the computer science field.
